# EXL-Time-Series-Forecasting-Hackathon-2022
Repository for my ML time series competition at EXL in python 2022

I participated in my company's machine learning hackathon competition for 2022. This year was a time series forecasting competition where we had to predict closing prices for the Nasdaq 100, Nifty 50 and FTSE 100 indexes on out-of-sample data. I am proud to say that I finished 14th out of 163(top 8.5%). 

I am only pasting my code for the Nasdaq100. While the code is a little messy, it indicates web scraping, basic exloratory data analysis, some feature engineering, data transformation, time series analysis (specifically autocorrelation and partial auto correlation), model testing and formatting my submission to the competition. 

I apologize in advance for not including my time series graphs or notes on certain blocks of the code.
